I'm so sorry for your loss. Losing a furry family member is incredibly tough, and my heart goes out to you. As a fellow pet parent who has also had to say goodbye to my babies as they crossed the rainbow bridge, I understand the pain and emptiness you're feeling right now.

I've removed the mass from the photo as requested. I hope this helps you remember her as the beautiful, happy girl she was.
